    DESCRIPTION
            "The MIB module to describe generic objects for network
            interface sub-layers.  This MIB is an updated version of
            MIB-II's ifTable, and incorporates the extensions defined in
            RFC 1229."

    REVISION      "200006140000Z"
    DESCRIPTION
            "Clarifications agreed upon by the Interfaces MIB WG, and
            published as RFC 2863."

-- Textual Conventions

InterfaceIndex ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
            "A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface or
            interface sub-layer in the managed system.  It is
            recommended that values are assigned contiguously starting
            from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer must remain
            constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
            network management system to the next re-initialization."
    SYNTAX       Integer32 (1..2147483647)

InterfaceIndexOrZero ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
            "This textual convention is an extension of the
            InterfaceIndex convention.  The latter defines a greater
            than zero value used to identify an interface or interface
            sub-layer in the managed system.  This extension permits the
            additional value of zero.  the value zero is object-specific
            and must therefore be defined as part of the description of
            any object which uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of
            zero might include situations where interface was unknown,
            or when none or all interfaces need to be referenced."
