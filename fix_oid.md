# OID Handling Cleanup Plan

## Overview

The OID handling throughout the manager and lib modules is architecturally broken. There's inconsistent handling between string and list formats, excessive conversions, and poor separation of concerns. This document outlines a phased approach to fix these issues.  Please check the code in OFTEN.  After every phase and even within the phase, review the changes and ensure they align with the architectural principles.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Internal Standard**: All internal OID handling MUST use lists of integers `[1,3,6,1,2,1,1,1,0]`
2. **External API Flexibility**: Public APIs MUST accept both string `"1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0"` and list `[1,3,6,1,2,1,1,1,0]` formats
3. **Boundary Conversion**: Convert external input to internal list format at API boundaries only
4. **No Internal Conversions**: Never convert internal lists to strings except for final user output
5. **Consistent Types**: Function signatures must be clear about whether they work with strings or lists

## Current Damage Assessment

### Critical Files Requiring Major Changes
- `snmp_mgr/core.ex` - Heavy string/list mixing, broken `parse_oid` function
- `snmp_mgr/adaptive_walk.ex` - String/list conversions throughout
- `snmp_mgr/bulk.ex` - Converting lists to strings unnecessarily
- `snmp_mgr/format.ex` - Mixed handling for output formatting
- `snmp_mgr/mib.ex` - String/list conversions in MIB operations
- `snmp_mgr/v2_walk.ex` - String conversion at entry point
- `snmp_mgr/walk.ex` - Likely similar issues

### Moderate Changes Required
- `snmp_lib/manager.ex` - Mixed handling in normalization functions
- `snmp_lib/mib/registry.ex` - String/list checking and conversions
- Main `snmp_mgr.ex` - API consistency issues

### Minor Changes Required
- `snmp_lib/mib/parser.ex` - Minor OID conversion issues

### Foundation (Good)
- `snmp_lib/oid.ex` - This module is actually well-designed and should be the foundation

## Phase 1: Foundation and API Boundaries

### Goals

### Expected Outcome ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
Full validation that the cleanup maintains compatibility while improving consistency and performance.

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Core OID tests passing (52 tests)
- âœ… Core operations tests passing (24 tests) 
- âœ… All compiler warnings fixed (length usage, @moduledoc typo)
- ðŸš§ Some regression tests need updates to match new implementation details
- ðŸš§ Need to verify all integration tests pass

## Implementation Guidelines

### Do's
- Always use `SnmpKit.SnmpLib.OID.string_to_list/1` for external input conversion
- Always use `SnmpKit.SnmpLib.OID.list_to_string/1` for final output conversion
- Keep function signatures clear about expected OID format
- Add `@spec` annotations to clarify OID types
- Use pattern matching to enforce list OIDs: `when is_list(oid)`

### Don'ts
- Don't add ad-hoc string/list conversion code
- Don't mix string and list handling in the same function
- Don't convert lists to strings for internal operations
- Don't change public API contracts that users depend on
- Don't skip input validation at API boundaries

### Error Handling
- Validate OID format at API boundaries using `SnmpKit.SnmpLib.OID.valid_oid?/1`
- Return clear error messages for invalid OID formats
- Maintain existing error types for backward compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

### Breaking Changes Risk
- **Risk**: Medium - Changes to internal APIs might break undocumented usage
- **Mitigation**: Maintain all public API signatures and behavior

### Performance Risk
- **Risk**: Low - Should improve performance by reducing conversions
- **Mitigation**: Measure before/after performance

### Regression Risk
- **Risk**: High - Complex changes across many modules
- **Mitigation**: Implement in phases with testing at each phase

## Success Criteria

1. All internal OID handling uses lists of integers
2. All public APIs accept both string and list formats
3. No unnecessary string/list conversions in internal operations
4. All existing tests continue to pass
5. Performance improvement measurable in bulk operations
6. Code is more maintainable with clear separation of concerns

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: âœ… 2-3 days (critical foundation work) - COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: âœ… 2-3 days (internal operations) - COMPLETED  
- **Phase 3**: âœ… 1-2 days (advanced features) - COMPLETED
- **Phase 4**: ðŸš§ 1-2 days (testing and validation) - IN PROGRESS

**Progress**: 5-7 days completed, 1-2 days remaining

This cleanup is essential for the long-term maintainability and performance of the SNMP toolkit. The current mixed approach creates bugs, performance issues, and makes the code difficult to reason about.

## Progress Summary

**Phase 1-3 Complete**: The critical architectural foundation is now in place:
- All API entry points convert external OIDs to internal list format
- Core operations (`snmp_mgr/core.ex`) standardized with proper parsing
- Walk operations (`walk.ex`, `v2_walk.ex`, `adaptive_walk.ex`) use lists internally
- Bulk operations (`bulk.ex`) keep lists internal, convert to strings only for final output
- MIB operations already properly structured
- Consistent validation and error handling throughout
- Advanced features and utilities reviewed and confirmed consistent
- All compiler warnings resolved

**Remaining Work**: Complete comprehensive testing and validation to ensure all integration scenarios work correctly.
