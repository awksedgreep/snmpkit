# SnmpKit v0.3.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Version:** 0.3.1  
**Git Tag:** v0.3.1  

## 📚 Documentation Improvements

### Enhanced Simulation Terminology

This patch release focuses on improving the documentation to better reflect the sophisticated nature of SnmpKit's device simulation capabilities.

#### Key Changes

**Terminology Updates:**
- ❌ "Mock devices" → ✅ "Simulated devices"
- ❌ "Mock implementation" → ✅ "Basic/Placeholder implementation"  
- ❌ "Mock backends" → ✅ "Simulated backends"
- ❌ "Mock CPU usage" → ✅ "Simulated CPU usage"

#### Why This Matters

The word "mock" implies something fake, limited, or superficial. SnmpKit's device simulation capabilities are actually:

- **🔥 Realistic** - Based on real device walk data from production equipment
- **📊 Comprehensive** - Hundreds of OIDs with proper SNMP behaviors  
- **⚡ Dynamic** - Counters increment, gauges fluctuate, values change over time
- **🧪 Production-Ready** - Suitable for integration testing and development
- **🎯 Accurate** - Faithful representation of actual SNMP devices (routers, switches, cable modems)

#### Files Updated

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `docs/unified-api-guide.md` - Comprehensive API guide
- `docs/v0.2.0-release-notes.md` - Historical release notes

**Source Code Comments:**
- `lib/snmpkit/snmp_lib/config.ex` - Configuration documentation
- `lib/snmpkit/snmp_lib/error_handler.ex` - Error handling comments
- `lib/snmpkit/snmp_sim/device.ex` - Device simulation comments
- `lib/snmpkit/snmp_sim/test_helpers/performance_helper.ex` - Performance testing
- `lib/snmpkit/snmp_sim/test_helpers/production_test_helper.ex` - Production testing
- `test/support/snmp_simulator.ex` - Test support documentation

## 🔧 Technical Details

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing APIs remain unchanged
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- No functional changes to code behavior

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ All 1,140 tests passing
- ✅ Zero compiler warnings
- ✅ Documentation builds successfully
- ✅ Clean git history maintained

## 📈 Impact

This release helps developers better understand that SnmpKit provides **enterprise-grade simulation capabilities** suitable for:

- **Integration Testing** - Complex SNMP scenarios with realistic device behaviors
- **Development** - Build against accurate device simulations without hardware
- **Performance Testing** - Scale testing with hundreds of simulated devices
- **Learning** - Hands-on SNMP education with realistic examples
- **Prototyping** - Rapid development with comprehensive device models

## 🚀 Upgrade Instructions

```elixir
# Update your dependency
{:snmpkit, "~> 0.3.1"}
```

**Migration:** No code changes required! This is a documentation-only release.

## 📖 What's Next

Version 0.3.1 sets the foundation for clearer communication about SnmpKit's capabilities. Future releases will continue to expand the simulation features with:

- Additional device profiles (enterprise switches, wireless APs, firewalls)
- Enhanced behavior modeling (traffic patterns, fault simulation)
- Performance optimization tools
- Extended MIB analysis capabilities
