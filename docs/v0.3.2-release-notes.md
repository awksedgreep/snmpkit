# SnmpKit v0.3.2 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Version:** 0.3.2  
**Git Tag:** v0.3.2  

## 🎯 Major Improvements

### Self-Contained Livebook Tour

This release completely transforms the SnmpKit interactive experience by making the Livebook tour **fully self-contained** without any external file dependencies.

#### Key Changes

**❌ Before (v0.3.1):**
- Required walk files in `priv/walks/` directory
- Relative path dependencies that often failed
- Complex setup requirements
- Limited to pre-existing device profiles

**✅ After (v0.3.2):**
- **Zero file dependencies** - works anywhere instantly
- **Complete device creation examples** using manual OID definitions
- **Five realistic device types** with comprehensive OID structures
- **Educational value** - shows exactly how SNMP devices work

### New Device Simulation Examples

The updated Livebook now demonstrates creating realistic network devices **from scratch**:

#### 1. 📡 **DOCSIS Cable Modem**
```elixir
cable_modem_oids = %{
  "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0" => "ARRIS SURFboard SB8200 DOCSIS 3.1 Cable Modem",
  "1.3.6.1.2.1.10.127.1.2.2.1.15.2" => 35,  # Signal/Noise ratio
  # ... comprehensive DOCSIS OID structure
}
```

#### 2. 🔀 **Enterprise Router**
- Cisco IOS simulation with multiple interfaces
- FastEthernet, Serial, and Loopback interfaces
- Realistic routing and SNMP statistics

#### 3. 🔌 **24-Port Managed Switch** 
- Programmatically generated port structure
- Realistic port states (active/inactive)
- Enterprise switch management OIDs

#### 4. 📶 **Dual-Band Wireless Access Point**
- 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio simulation
- Channel configuration and client counts
- Wireless-specific enterprise MIBs

#### 5. 🖨️ **Network Printer**
- HP LaserJet enterprise printer simulation
- Toner/supply level monitoring
- Job statistics and paper tray status

## 📚 Documentation Enhancements

### Comprehensive Examples Added

**New Example Files:**
- `examples/quick_cable_modem.exs` - Simplest device creation approach
- `examples/cable_modem_simulation.exs` - Advanced simulation techniques
- `examples/cable_modem_profile.json` - Structured JSON profile template

### Educational Value

The Livebook now serves as a **complete SNMP education platform**:

- **OID Structure Learning** - See how real device OIDs are organized
- **Data Type Examples** - `Counter32`, `TimeTicks`, `Gauge32`, etc.
- **Enterprise MIBs** - Cisco, HP, Ubiquiti vendor-specific OIDs
- **Device Behavior** - Counters increment, values fluctuate realistically

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

### Device Creation Methods

The release showcases **multiple approaches** for creating simulated devices:

#### Method 1: Manual OID Maps
```elixir
{:ok, profile} = SnmpKit.SnmpSim.ProfileLoader.load_profile(
  :device_type,
  {:manual, oid_map},
  behaviors: [:counter_increment, :time_based_changes]
)
```

#### Method 2: JSON Profiles
```elixir
{:ok, profile} = SnmpKit.SnmpSim.ProfileLoader.load_profile(
  :device_type,
  {:json_profile, "device.json"}
)
```

#### Method 3: Programmatic Generation
```elixir
# Generate 24 switch ports programmatically
switch_oids = Enum.reduce(1..24, %{}, fn port, acc ->
  Map.merge(acc, %{
    "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.#{port}" => "GigabitEthernet0/#{port}",
    "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.#{port}" => 1  # operational status
  })
end)
```

### Behavioral Simulation

Enhanced support for realistic device behaviors:
- **Counter Increment** - Traffic counters automatically increase
- **Time-Based Changes** - Values evolve over time
- **Signal Fluctuation** - Wireless/cable signal levels vary
- **Supply Depletion** - Printer toner levels decrease
- **Job Simulation** - Print job processing

## 🚀 Platform Compatibility

### Universal Deployment
The self-contained approach makes SnmpKit accessible everywhere:

- ✅ **Livebook Cloud** - No file upload requirements
- ✅ **Docker Containers** - Self-contained execution
- ✅ **Educational Environments** - Zero setup friction
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipelines** - Reliable testing without file dependencies
- ✅ **Development Laptops** - Works without project structure

### Easy Onboarding
New users can now:
1. Open the Livebook
2. Run cells sequentially  
3. See realistic SNMP devices responding immediately
4. Learn by example without complex setup
