# SnmpKit v0.3.3 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Version:** 0.3.3  
**Git Tag:** v0.3.3  

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Livebook Variable Scope Fix

This patch release fixes a critical issue in the interactive Livebook tour where variable scope was not properly managed across cells.

#### Issue Fixed
- **Variable undefined error**: `cable_modem_target` and `router_target` variables were not accessible in subsequent cells
- **Cell execution failures**: Users experienced runtime errors when running cells sequentially
- **Poor user experience**: Broken examples interrupted the learning flow

#### Solution Implemented
- **Explicit variable definitions**: Added target definitions at the start of each relevant cell
- **Consistent variable names**: Ensured `cable_modem_target = "127.0.0.1:1161"` and `router_target = "127.0.0.1:1162"` are available
- **Cell independence**: Each cell now works independently without relying on previous cell state
- **Improved reliability**: All code examples now execute successfully in any order

#### Files Modified
- `livebooks/snmpkit_tour.livemd` - Fixed variable scope across all cells

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Variable Scope Pattern
Each cell that uses device targets now includes:

```elixir
# Set targets for this cell
cable_modem_target = "127.0.0.1:1161"
router_target = "127.0.0.1:1162"
```

This ensures:
- ✅ **Reliability** - Cells execute successfully regardless of execution order
- ✅ **Clarity** - Variables are explicitly defined where used
- ✅ **Maintainability** - Easy to understand and modify
- ✅ **User Experience** - No unexpected variable errors

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ All cells tested individually
- ✅ Sequential execution verified
- ✅ Variable definitions consistent
- ✅ No breaking changes to functionality

## 🚀 Upgrade Instructions

```elixir
# Update your dependency
{:snmpkit, "~> 0.3.3"}
```

**Migration:** No code changes required for library usage. This only affects the Livebook tour experience.

## 📊 Impact

### Before (v0.3.2)
- ❌ Variable scope errors in Livebook
- ❌ Cells failed when run out of order
- ❌ Poor learning experience
- ❌ Runtime errors interrupted tutorial flow

### After (v0.3.3)
- ✅ All cells execute independently
- ✅ Clear variable definitions in each cell
- ✅ Smooth learning experience
- ✅ Reliable tutorial execution

## 🎯 What's Next

This patch ensures the Livebook tour provides a seamless educational experience. Future releases will focus on:
- Additional device simulation examples
- Enhanced MIB compilation tutorials
- Performance optimization guides
- Integration examples with monitoring platforms
